PanGen
=======

PanGen is a simple GUI tool to synthetically generate one or more debit/credit card
numbers (PANs). Card numbers generated will conform to LUHN digit check formula. Also
no duplicate card number will be generated within the same number generation session.

For obvious numbers no corresponding card expiry dates will be generated. 

The set of generated card numbers can be exported and saved to a file for later use.
